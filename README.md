## App Brainstorming (Step 4)
LinkedIn:
 - Really good job application system
 - Showing mutual connections as 2nd or 3rd
   
Discord:
 - Switching over call from phone to computer
 - Notifications when someone is online or streaming a game

TheCut:
 - Appointment Availability shown
 - Can handle payments in app so no need to pay in person

An app idea I'd like to continue would be my MeaMemoria application. Its an application that takes an image and allows you to add a lot of customization to photo albums adding voice recordings, music, and more. I'd like to implement a feature that includes adding music to albums as a vibe, customizing the layout to your liking, and also having shared customizable albums with someone.

## Notes

Describe any challenges encountered while building the app.
